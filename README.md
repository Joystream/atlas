## Contributing

All community contributions to the project are welcome. Before starting any work, it's a good idea to get familiar with the following additional documents:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - this will lay out our expectations regarding work process in GitHub, etc.
- [Code conventions and styleguide](docs/styleguide.md) - this should help you understand code conventions we use
- [Technical overview](docs/overview.md) - this document describes Atlas' technical architecture, what data sources it fetches from, what tech is used to build it, etc.

If you are looking for a good place to start, check out the [good first issue label](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [bug label](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

### Quickstart

To get started working with Atlas codebase, first clone the repo, install all dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Joystream/atlas
cd atlas
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start the development server on `localhost:3000`.

### Design

To get started working with Atlas designs in Figma, visit [Joystream's official Figma Community profile](https://figma.com/@joystream) (available early 2022) and duplicate files you're interested in remixing or using as a base for your work.

While most of the Atlas design documentation is kept within Figma files, for meta documentation visit [Atlas Design Space on Notion](https://grizzled-corleggy-af8.notion.site/Design-Space-487ed84966fa495a8c037935639ca681).
