        3. Qualify for the rewards paid in JOY tokens for signing up to to this program.
        4. If you chose to opt in to auto-sync service, you grant permission for JS Genesis operated service to upload all videos from your YouTube channel to Joystream blockchain and storage system, available to display on $VITE_APP_NAME App or any other app connected to Joystream blockchain and qualify for the additional rewards paid in JOY tokens for new videos added to your Joystream channel via automatic upload service.

        Rewards are subject to the verified status of the channel, assigned by the program operators.

        ## YouTube Partnership Program Terms and Conditions

        ## Who is the program for

        The program is targeted at YouTube creators with substantial published videos and subscribers. The program involves compensation in JOY tokens for YouTube creators who choose to opt in, meet the qualification criteria and perform actions that are linked to rewards.

        ## YPP Rewards and Key Information

        There is a separate document, [YouTube Partner Program Outline](https://www.notion.so/joystream/YouTube-Partner-Program-Outline-d492c2eb88ff4ace955b5f2902ec21fb?pvs=4). All the program particulars, such as: how to join YouTube Partnership Program, rewards calculation explanation and example, payment information are contained in the program document on Notion. The company has the right to update the terms of the program upon its discretion, unilaterally and without any prior notice. Significant changes will be communicated via public communication channels, such as Discord server or social media accounts.

        ## How YouTube Partnership Program rewards are paid

        When YouTube creators create Joystream channel app, they get an auto-generated polkadot account assigned to this channel automatically. This account is bound to their channel, and cannot be updated. This account can hold JOY tokens.

        The data collected and recorded in the internal DB with regards to uploaded content and referral stats will be informed with when deriving the cyclical rewards to the participating channels.

        Rewards are paid only for verified channels. Rewards are paid via direct transfers from JS Genesis specific account to the creators' Joystream channel account. Rewards are paid by JS Genesis company, from the funds (tokens) budgeted for the purpose of operational support.

        ## Other ways Joystream Channels can get rewards

        Joystream DAO operating model encapsulates rewards for Joystream channels paid out outside of the YouTube Partnership Program. Gleev Operator, JS Genesis AS has no responsibility or control over such mechanisms and they are listed below.

        1. Payout Proposal to Channels by DAO Council.
        2. Direct Payment from DAO Working Group Budget by WG Lead.
        3. Direct Member Payments from any member of Joystream Network.

        ## How to withdraw rewards

        In order to create Joystream channel, a Joystream membership is required. It can be created free of charge using the $VITE_APP_NAME App, hosted on gleev.xyz or Pioneer app hosted on  pioneerapp.xyz. Joystream membership requires a substrate account, created using any wallets compatible with Polkadot ecosystem.

        From the channel account JOY token can be transferred (withdrawn) to the member account via $VITE_APP_NAME app interfaces or polkadot.js app (calling transfer extrinsic). This transaction must be signed with the membership controller account, that was used to create Joystream channel.

        ## Program Partners Terms and Conditions

        If you opt in to the Auto-sync feature you also agree to [YouTube's Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms)](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and [Google's Privacy Policy (https://www.google.com/policies/privacy).](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy)

        This requests access to the necessary information via YouTube API, namely "read_only" scope to your YouTube channel data. This happens during the authorisation flow as part of the YPP program onboarding. The App fetches only the information that YouTube exposes in the read_only scope and required to effectively operate the program via the open API.

        Account Info: email address.
        Channel Info: name, date created, URL, number of followers, number of comments, number of views, number of videos,
        Videos info: video titles, videos date uploaded, video subtitles.

        If auto-sync service is enabled, it will refetch channel information once every 24 hours, and poll video information once every 30 minutes to detect new uploads and automatically upload them to your $VITE_APP_NAME Channel.

        Only public videos are synced. Videos are synced in resolution of 720px or lower. HD videos will be supported as the program matures. Subtitles synced only in English, and all other languages are not supported at the time of program launch, but will be supported in the future.  The queue of syncing is defined based on the proprietary algorithm developed and maintained by JSGenesis team. It may be updated at any time without prior notice.

        If access of the JSGenesis operated backend app to your YouTube channel is disabled on the side of Google account, then you are automatically opted out from the YPP program and no longer qualify for rewards.

        #### Rights of Jsgenesis and Third Party Applications

        Accepting these terms and conditions between the creator and JS Genesis AS, warrants the rights for $VITE_APP_NAME App to sync the content from creator’s YouTube Channel with the Joystream Network. 

        Syncing content means replicating or uploading the creator’s content to the storage nodes and make it available to content distribution nodes of Joystream Network infrastructure which is operated by Joystream DAO. The content record of ownership by the channel created by YouTube creators signing up to YouTube Partnership Program, is kept on the Joystream Blockchain, that is a public ledger. Joystream platform is an open source project and its operating model implies multiple Apps and Gateways connected to Joystream blockchain and network infrastructure. 

        Synced content can be monetized by any participants of the Joystream Network, and specifically gateways (Apps) connected to Joystream blockchain and infrastructure. All connected Apps can distribute, display and monetize creator's video content and its attributes, such as likes by members of network, comments, reactions, metadata of channel and membership owning the video content.

        Creator has the rights to claim monetization of their content as part of general platform T&Cs, and the compensation in JOY tokens from JS Genesis AS for the synced content from YouTube as part of the YouTube Partnership Program agreement.

        For the full duration of the content existing on Joystream Network and as long as creator does not delete their content and/or channel from the blockchain, any third party application can use the content of such channel as described in this paragraph. This applies even to the cases when Jsgenesis AS is no longer operating $VITE_APP_NAME App and seizes to exist as a legal entity.

        ## License

        Auto-sync service will read the videos meta-data fields, including title, description, date created, duration, language and license and transfer them to the newly created video on the creators Joystream channel.

        In case the original YouTube video license was set to Standard-YouTube-License, such videos will be assigned Joystream-license, limiting the replication and usage of such content without the explicit consent of the author.

        In case the original YouTube video license was set to Creative Commons, such videos will be assigned CC0 license, allowing all viewers to distribute such videos freely in the public domain, allowing them to be built upon, enhanced and reused by others for any purpose without restrictions.

        License can be updated manually for each videos individually from the list of available options.

        ## Auto-sync service

        In order to simplify the upload of content to $VITE_APP_NAME App, JS Genesis team has built a dedicated backend application, integrated with YouTube and $VITE_APP_NAME to facilitate the content upload. It is hosted on the JSGenesis operated infrastructure and operated by JS Genesis team.

        ## Opt out

        Channel can opt out from auto-sync feature by choosing this option in the settings tab of the YPP dashboard. Opting out from Auto-sync would stop automated upload of all new content published to YouTube channel, but would keep the $VITE_APP_NAME channel in the YPP program, meaning that referral rewards can still be collected.

        Opting out from the entire program can also be done from the settings tab. This will result the channel marked in the internal data base as "opted-out" and payout calculation for this channel will stop for any activities undertaken.

        Already uploaded content will remain on the platform but can be deleted by the user at any time.

        ## Termination

        Any channel can be suspended from the program at any time without any disclosure of the reason. The reasons can be for violating the adherence to the content vertical policy, and continuously posting videos that do not match the content expectation/ category requirements.

        If the channel is suspended from the program, it can no longer re-apply with the same credentials and can barred indefinitely or for the period to the discretion of JS Genesis team.
