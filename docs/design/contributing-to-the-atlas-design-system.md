# Contributing to the Atlas Design System

Below is an overview of the contribution path in the Atlas Design System. While it's been created primarily with Atlas designers & engineers in mind, everyone is welcome to contribute to the Atlas Design System by submitting their proposal via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Joystream/atlas/issues/new).

ℹ️ *Link to a specific GitHub issue template to be provided by Adam Ruthendorf-Przewoski by Nov 12th 2021 at the latest.*

## Path
![Contribution path](src/Contribution%20Proces.png)

### Legend
As contribution ideas can come in different shapes and sizes, star icons are used to determine the contribution path for each size. Steps marked with one star icon apply to all contribution sizes.

Stars | Contribution size | Examples
---|--- | ---
⭐️ | Small | Making a minor change in a component, creating a new icon, etc.
⭐️⭐️ | Medium | Adding a new variant of a component, a missing piece of documentation, etc.
⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Large | Creating a new component from scratch, making a change in design tokens, etc.


### 1. Propose
#### 1.1 Contribution proposal
A proposal is sent via GitHub issue by the proposal author.
#### 1.2 Backlog grooming
By default, all incoming proposals land in the proposals inbox on GitHub, awaiting a backlog grooming. During backlog grooming, occurring (most likely) every two weeks, proposals are assigned with priorities and sizes, determining the order in which they're tackled.

### 2. Design
#### 2.1 Design kick-off meeting
A meeting between the proposal author and a designated member of the Design System team to discuss details about the proposal and gather all requirements.
#### 2.2 Design
A designated Design System team member designs the solution based on the previously gathered requirements.
#### 2.3 Design review meeting
A meeting between the proposal author and a designated member of the Design System team to present the solution and gather feedback.
#### 2.4 Technical design review meeting
A meeting between designated members of the Tech and Design System teams to discuss technical aspects of the solution and whether it can be implemented in the proposed shape and form.

> This is an iterative process and steps 2.2-2.4 can be expected to take a few rounds of revisions before proceeding to the next steps of the contribution path.

### 3. Document
#### 3.1 Engineering kick-off meeting
A meeting between designated members of the Tech and Design System teams to discuss technical details and requirements of the proposal design. This is an opportunity for both:
- the Design System team member to learn what information should be specifically included in the proposal design documentation,
- to get a batter understanding of the solution and learn the context.


#### 3.2 Writing down design docs
Writind down designs documentation.

### 4. Code
#### 4.1 Design kick-off meeting
A designated Tech team member implements the solution based on the  documenation.
#### 4.2 Implementation review meeting
A designated Design System team member designs the solution based on the previously gathered requirements.

> This is an iterative process and steps 4.1 and 4.2 can be expected to take a few rounds of revisions before completing.

### 5. Release
The proposal author is notified about their idea being released and ready to be used.
